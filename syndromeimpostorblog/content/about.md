# Hi there! 👋

I go by **Syndrome Impostor**, I'm a full-time bug bounty hunter and security researcher with a passion for finding vulnerabilities in complex systems. Currently, I specialize in **OAuth and OIDC implementations**, where I've discovered security flaws that have helped secure millions of user accounts.

## 🔍 What I Do

My background spans **systems architecture**, **networking**, and **security engineering leadership**, giving me a unique perspective to identify vulnerabilities that exist between different layers of technology. I excel at:

- **OAuth/OIDC Security Research** - Finding authentication and authorization bypasses
- **Web Application Security** - Discovering logic flaws and implementation vulnerabilities  
- **Systems Architecture Analysis** - Understanding how complex systems interact and where they break
- **Security Engineering** - Building secure solutions and improving security practices

## 🎯 My Approach

I believe the most interesting vulnerabilities are found at the intersection of different technologies and systems. My methodology combines:

- Deep technical understanding of protocols and standards
- Systematic approach to security testing
- Creative thinking to find edge cases and unusual attack vectors
- Collaboration with security teams to understand business impact
