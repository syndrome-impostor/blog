I go by **Syndrome Impostor**. I am a full-time bug bounty hunter and security researcher specializing in OAuth and OIDC implementations.

My handle was given to me by two very close friends. I carry it as a reminder that nearly everyone in this industry experiences impostor syndrome, and we all have something valuable to contribute. 

## 🎯 Technical Focus

I focus on finding vulnerabilities at the intersection of different technologies, specifically:

- **OAuth/OIDC:** Authentication and authorization bypasses.
- **Application Logic:** Complex business logic errors that automated scanners miss.
- **Systems Architecture:** Identifying flaws in the communication between distinct technology layers.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I am available for **conference speaking**, **collaborative research**, and **consulting**.
